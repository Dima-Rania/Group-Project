        <h2>Rania Abo Aleneen</h2>
        <p>
            Before starting this Master program in information sience , I studied to become a Front End Web Devolper at the University of Bor√•s. In my studies, I focused on organizing digital content, making sure that information was easy to find and use. 
            The web developer program provided me with foundational knowledge in various aspects of digital content creation, including content strategy, user experience principles, and information architecture. I learned how to effectively categorize and present content to ensure that users could easily find and navigate information, which is important in creating a seamless and engaging online experience. 
            and I have studied Economics at the university of Damascus which ment handling and structuring economic information. I also have practical experience from my work at a health center in Damascus were I reorganized an index card system When studying for the Bachelor's degree I could connect this experience, to the theories behind information science.
